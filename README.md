ChatAI

Version: 1.0
API: Bukkit / Spigot 1.21+

A drop-in Bukkit plugin that brings vanilla Minecraft villagers (and server chat) to life with AI-powered dialogue, dynamic “villages,” and a simple quest system—no client-side mods required.
🔥 Features

    Global Server Chat Bot
        Welcomes new players with a unique AI-generated greeting
        Responds to chat messages in character as your friendly in-game assistant
        Knows real-time placeholders: world time, uptime, online player count, weather

    Villager NPC AI Chat
        Sneak + right-click any vanilla villager to start a session
        Each villager gets a persistent “Brutus the Blacksmith”–style name
        Villagers clustered by proximity into dynamically named villages
        ~25% of villagers per village become quest-givers
        Non-quest villagers will point you to your local quest-giver

    Simple Quest System
        “Kill X skeletons/zombies” or “Fetch Y diamonds” tasks, with built-in action-bar progress
        Rewards are given via console commands
        Progress notifications on kill/item pickup, completion sends action-bar + chat

Installation: (-I will make this a simple installer soon) -Still busy putting the first version in place along with decent easy to understand installer.
